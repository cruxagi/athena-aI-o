Quantum-coherent search across local substrates. Zero data leaks.

## SBLM Engine (Small Behavior Language Model)
Behavior emerges from phase synchronization rather than token prediction.

- **KuramotoSubstrate**: 64 coupled oscillators that converge toward shared phase.
- **IntentClassifier**: Hash-based mapping from queries to phase perturbations.
- **BehaviorLibrary**: Phase-encoded response templates that align with substrate state.
- **OmegaMetric**: Energy-like synchrony measure that tracks collective coherence.
- **SBLMEngine**: Wires all pieces together, nudges phases, simulates steps, and reports the closest behavior.
